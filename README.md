# Copula-Structure-Analysis
Implementation of paper Copula Structure Analysis by Claudia Klüppelberg and  Gabriel Kuhn.

When we analyse high dimensional data, in the process of understanding dependence structure, we aim at dimension reduction. In the framework of correlation representing linear dependence, correlation structure analysis is a classic tool. Correlation structure analysis is based on the assumption that the correlation matrix of the data satisfies the equation R = R(θ), where θ is a parametric vector. The whole decomposing of correlation structure is justified only when the data is normally distributed. For a normal distribution the dependence is uniquely determined by its correlation matrix. For real multivariate data like financial data where it is not normally distributed, some margins are heavy tailed following occurrence of non-linear dependence, we try to avoid the problems created by non-existing moments or different marginal distributions by using copulas. 

In this paper, the authors introduced a new method of elliptical copulas being copulas of elliptical distributions as they are very flexible and easy to handle in higher dimensions .The correlation structure analysis is there- fore called as copula structure analysis. The main advantage of this method is that we need only IID data to ensure consis- tency and asymptotic normality of the estimated factor loading’s as well as asymptotic χ2 distribution.
